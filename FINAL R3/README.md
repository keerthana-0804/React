In this environment, an agent is placed on a grid representing a frozen lake, and the objective is to navigate from the starting position(or initial state) to the goal without falling into ice patches,scattered throughout the lake. The agent can take discrete actions (left(0), up(1), down(2), right(3)) to traverse the grid.
